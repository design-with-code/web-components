# Designing with Code â€“ Part 3: SAP Web Components

Our daily work is busy and usually there is a long list of tasks lining up, designs to be completed, discussions to be held, and reviews to be conducted, that there is no time to take a step back and think. Even if we know that some tasks could be done more efficiently, we often stick to the existing patterns because we lack the time to explore something different.

In the first part of this series of articles, I described that my time as fellow in one of our product areas gave me the possibility to take this step back and to learn how to create prototypes using our major UI technologies. I used this to complement and complete my design workflow and not to replace the design phase. In the second article, I described, how design tools like Figma can be used in a way that already prepares your designs for implementation by using component libraries, styles, and layouts.

In this third article, I want to give you an easy start into the development of prototypes using SAP web components. Even if you have no idea of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS this will help you to understand, how things belong together. If you have a basic understanding of web development, this might open you the path into your own prototypes by offering you a simple and portable setup.
