# Designing with Code - SAP Web Components

This repository contains resources and exercises that accompany a series of articles called "Designing with Code" published on the [SAP community platform](https://community.sap.com/). The articles have the goal to motivate and help designers to start creating their own design prototypes using the available SAP technologies.

The examples here are for [SAP Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents), a full web components library with more than 60 enterprise-ready UI components.
