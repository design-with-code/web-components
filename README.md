# Designing with Code

This repository contains resources and exercises that accompany a series of articles called "Designing with Code" published on the [SAP community platform](https://community.sap.com/). The articles have the goal to motivate and help designers to start creating their own design prototypes using the available SAP technologies.

Many designers see the value in knowing more about the technology they use as basis for their designs on a daily basis, but the hurdle to get started is just to high, especially if they are busy in their daily routine and under pressure to deliver.

This series of articles gives an introduction to our main UI technologies and how they can be used by designers without the need to set up complicated development environments and server.

The following articles form part of this series :

* [Part 1: Change of Perspective](./Part-01-Change-Of-Perspective/README.md), [SAP Community](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/10/29/designing-with-code/) - Introduction and motivation for this serieas of articles. The experience from my fellowship as product designer and the experience of creating my first own prototype using web components and later SAPUI5.
* [Part 2: Crossing the Bridge](./Part-02-Crossing-The-Bridge/README.md) - Buildig the connection between design tools like Figma and creating running prototypes using the target frontend technology.
* [Part 3: SAP Web Components](./Part-03-SAP-Web-Components/README.md) - Creating the very first setup using the SAP web components library and nothing else. Setting up a prototyping environment without any overhead and installation.
* [Part 4: Data, Document Object Model, and Events](./Part-04-Data-DOM-And-Events/README.md) - Looking deeper into advanced concepts like modelling data using JSON, manipulating the document object model (DOM) and building up the application UI programmatically, and adding interactivity with events.

The following parts are still planned:

* (Planned) Part 5: Introducing SAPUI5
* (Planned) Part 6: A prototype with SAPUI5
* (Planned) Part 7: Advanced concepts in SAPUI5
* (Planned) Part 8a: SAPUI5 and accessibility
* (Planned) Part 8b: Responsiveness
* (Planned) Part 9: Introduction UI5 Web Components for Angular NGX
* (Planned) Part 10: A prototype with Angular
* (Planned) Part 11: Advanced topics in Angular
* (Planned) Part 12: Discussing the different approaches

The folders in this repository contain material and examples for each of the articles in the series.
